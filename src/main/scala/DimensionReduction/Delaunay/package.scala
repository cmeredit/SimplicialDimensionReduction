package DimensionReduction

/** Provides an implementation of Delaunay triangulation.
 *
 *  ==Overview==
 *  The main objects in this package are [[DimensionReduction.Delaunay.DelaunayUtil]] and
 *  [[DimensionReduction.Delaunay.QuickHullUtil]]. These objects provide methods for obtaining the Delaunay
 *  triangulation and convex hull of a set of points, respectively.
