/** Provides utility objects for dimension reduction.
 *
 *  ==Overview==
 *  The subpackages of this package are [[DBSCAN]] and [[Delaunay]]. The former package provides an implementation of
 *  the DBSCAN algorithm, while the latter package provides algorithms that produce the Delaunay simplicialization and
 *  convex hull of a set of points. The [[Delaunay]] package also has a Linear Algebra helper object,
 *  [[Delaunay.LinearUtil]]
